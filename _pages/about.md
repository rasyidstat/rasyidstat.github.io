### Hello, I'm Rasyid Ridha.

I am currently working in one of Unicorn company in Indonesia as a data guy (previously in telecommunication industry), mining and gaining interesting insights from the huge amount of data. 

Most of my works are done using R with [tidyverse](http://tidyverse.org/) philosophy. I do end to end analysis using R for database connection (`RJDBC`, `DBI`, `bigrquery`), data manipulation (`dplyr`, `tidyr`), data visualization (`ggplot2`, `leaflet`), machine learning (`caret`) and reporting (R Markdown). I also develop R packages such as:

- [smartr](http://www.smartfren.com): internal R package that I use for my daily work in previous company (data connector to Hive and Presto), similar to `Rbnb` at Airbnb 
- [rojek](https://www.gojek.com): internal R package that I use for my current daily work , similar to `Rbnb` at Airbnb 
- [nusantr](https://github.com/rasyidstat/nusantr): an R package contain many things (built-in functions, datasets, spatial data, etc.) related to my country, Indonesia
- [liburrr](https://github.com/rasyidstat/liburrr): an R package for Indonesia holiday data and some built-in date functions
- [mrsq](https://github.com/rasyidstat/mrsq): my personal R package (data connector to SQLite and PostgreSQL for my [DataGue](http://rasyidridha.com/blog/collect-all-the-data/), personal analytics project)

Let's discuss interesting things, especially the one that is related to data.
